          <h2>Los Angeles Angels star Shohei Ohtani not in lineup for series opener vs. Tampa Bay Rays</h2>
          <p>
            The day started with a 4:30 a.m. wake-up call. I hopped on a bullet train from Tokyo Station at 6 a.m. to travel to Hanamaki, Iwate, the area of the country that produced the legendary Ohtani. I wrote yesterday that we were
            traveling 150 mph — it was more like 200 mph, as this beautiful train whisked us across the Japanese countryside with speed and style. <br />While we were en route, I was offered many options for breakfast. Most of them involved
            tuna in some form. My interpreter and guide, Masa — who, I will take every opportunity to say, has been key to making this trip possible — chowed down on a sandwich made of two pancakes with beans in the middle. He was quite
            proud of his selection. <br />Now, a bit about our destination. Iwate is one of the northernmost prefectures (similar to a state) on Japan's biggest island. It is scenic, mountainous and apparently a great snowboarding
            destination in the winter. Within Iwate, Hanamaki is a quiet town that reminds me of my hometown in Virginia. <br />Once we arrived at the train station, we headed straight to yet another baseball field. This one was very
            different from the bright lights of the Tokyo Dome. The Mizusawa Little League field is where Ohtani learned to play the game as a child. I learned that the river over the right-field fence actually played a big role in that
            story. As Ohtani started to develop some pop, he made it a habit to hit balls over the fence and into the river to be lost forever. Eventually, Ohtani's coach came to him and asked that he stop hitting balls into the river
            because they could not afford to continue to purchase new ones. So Ohtani learned to drive baseballs into left field consistently, building the foundation of his ability to hit to all fields in the majors.
